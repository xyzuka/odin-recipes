    <p>TThis is an easy recipe. My family just loves the mushroom topping. Add some boiled carrots and mashed potatoes to make a wonderful meal.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon onion powder </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme </li>
            <li>1 pound New York strip steaks, cut 3/4 inch thick </li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms </li>
            <li>¼ cup minced shallot </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons red wine </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil </li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste </li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together the paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and thyme. Sprinkle onto each side of the steaks, pressing in so it adheres. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallots; cook and stir for about 1 minute. Add the mushrooms, and cook for a few more minutes, until tender. Stir in the red wine, and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated. Remove from the heat and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Fry steaks for 5 to 7 minutes per side, or to your desired degree of doneness. Remove to a plate and let rest for a few minutes. Top with mushrooms and serve.</li>
        </ol>
