    <p>These delicious breakfast cakes are said to resemble those from a famous pancake house. When replacing milk for buttermilk, increase lemon juice to 1 ½ tablespoons. Serve topped with butter.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar </li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 dash salt </li>
            <li>1 egg </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, or as needed </li>

        </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the buttermilk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract in a bowl; stir in the sugar. Whisk in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, combining the batter with just a few strokes to moisten. Leave the lumps.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg and lemon juice together; gently stir into the batter. Refrigerate the batter for at least 30 minutes, up to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and grease with the butter. Pour 1/3 cup of batter per pancake into the skillet and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 minutes. Flip with spatula and brown the other side, about 2 more minutes.</li>
        </ol>
